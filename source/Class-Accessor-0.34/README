DESCRIPTION

    This module automagically generates accessors/mutators for your class.

    Most of the time, writing accessors is an exercise in cutting and
    pasting. You usually wind up with a series of almost identical methods,
    one for each piece of data in your object. While some will be unique,
    doing value checks and special storage tricks, most will simply be
    exercises in repetition.

    If you make your module a subclass of Class::Accessor and declare your
    accessor fields with mk_accessors() then you'll find yourself with a set
    of automatically generated accessors, which can even be customized!

    The basic set up is very simple:

        package My::Class;
        use base qw(Class::Accessor);
        My::Class->mk_accessors( qw(foo bar car) );

    Done. My::Class now has simple foo(), bar() and car() accessors defined.

    If you prefer a Moose-like interface you can do this instead:

        package My::Class;
        use Class::Accessor "moose-like";
        has foo => ( is => "rw" );
        has bar => ( is => "rw" );
        has car => ( is => "rw" );

    Done, again.
